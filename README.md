# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the dataset’s structure, explore relationships between features, and identify factors that may have influenced passenger survival. The analysis includes generating summary statistics, creating visualizations, detecting patterns and anomalies, and drawing feature-level inferences.

## What Was Done
- Imported the Titanic dataset and explored its structure using basic info and summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles).
- Checked for missing values and reviewed data types.
- Created histograms and boxplots for numeric features to understand distributions and detect outliers.
- Generated a pairplot and a correlation matrix to examine relationships between numerical features.
- Analyzed passenger survival patterns based on different attributes including class, gender, age, fare, family size, deck, and embarkation point.
- Created new features such as passenger titles extracted from names, family size, fare per person, and age groups for deeper analysis.
- Visualized how these features relate to survival rates using bar plots, count plots, and scatter plots.
- Included an interactive scatter plot (Age vs Fare) with survival status for detailed exploration.
- Identified key trends, patterns, and anomalies such as higher survival rates for first-class passengers, females, younger passengers, and those paying higher fares.
- Documented feature-level inferences based on visualizations.
